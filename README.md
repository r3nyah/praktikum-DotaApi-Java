## Volley is`t Volleyball
  The Volleyball Library was a product that Google had to introduce to make it easier to exchange data without creating very long lines of code. By default volleyball uses the sync method.

## Volleyball offers the following benefits:
- [x] Perform a request queuing and prioritization (Priority in a queue).
- [x] Very effective for cache and storage efficiency (memory).
- [x] Can make class changes as needed.
- [x] Can cancel in a request.
  
   ##  How to add Volley to a project:
1. Create new project.
2. Open build.gradle(Module: app) and add the following dependency:
```java
  dependencies {
        ...
        implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1'
    }
```
3. In AndroidManifest.xml add the internet permission:
```java
 <uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.INTERNET />"
```
## What is JSON?
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪˌsɒn/) 
  is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store 
  and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). 
  It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.<br>
  
  JSON is made of two structures:
  - [x] A collection of name/value pairs. In some languages, this is represented as an object, record, structure, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
  - [x] An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is expressed as an array, vector, list, or sequence.JSON data structures are called universal data structures. Basically,

all modern programming languages support JSON data structures in the same or different forms.
